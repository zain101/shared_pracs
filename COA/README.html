## IF you get error in binary multiplication append 4 more bit before

## **if you encounter any error feel free to modify or let me know**

*   you can simply use dosbox to run this code.

*   To RUN this code in  * NIX/GCC   systems you need to install  LIBCONIO :

*   use  this link to download

    *   [Dropbox]((http://www.dropbox.com/s/38mk99yfw0kf892/libconio-1.0.0.tar.gz://www.dropbox.com/s/38mk99yfw0kf892/libconio-1.0.0.tar.gz "zainul ")
*   **how to install libconio ?**

#### - refer to **INSTALL** file  in libconio folder. OR follow these steps.

*   1 cd to the directory containing the package's source code and type
 `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
 using`csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
 `sh ./configure' instead to prevent`csh' from trying to execute
 `configure' itself.

Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
 messages telling which features it is checking for.

*   2 Type `make' to compile the package.

*   3 Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
 the package.

*   4 Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
 documentation.

*   how to compile?

*   1  gcc sourcefile.c -lconio*   2  ./a.out
